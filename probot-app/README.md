# render-bpmn

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/pinussilvestrus/github-bpmn.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/pinussilvestrus/github-bpmn)

A GitHub App built with [Probot](https://github.com/probot/probot) that automatically renders BPMN files on GitHub Issues and Pull Requests.

## Setup

```sh
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Run the bot
npm start
```

This will start the Probot App on http://localhost:3000 and be ready for registering. __Note:__ on additional start after registering could be needed work properly, causing registering delays to the smee.io proxy.
